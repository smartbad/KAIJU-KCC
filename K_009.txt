CCTV Prompt (Turn 01 Intro Visual)

A low-resolution city surveillance camera captures a motionless tabby-shaped figure perched atop rubble in the middle of a ruined intersection. Its glowing yellow eyes pierce through the ash-laden twilight, and its large bat-like wings remain half-unfurled, casting sharp silhouettes across the cracked pavement. The feed flickers slightly as background mist rolls in, and several bystanders appear frozen mid-step—staring in silence, unaware of the camera. Audio cuts to static just before the figure's head tilts imperceptibly toward the lens.

Image Prompt (For AI rendering)

A haunting Kaiju cat sitting in the middle of a ruined city, with glowing yellow eyes and large leathery bat wings. The creature is eerily still, exuding both cuteness and dread. Its tabby fur is slightly dirty from the rubble, and its wings are outstretched, casting dramatic shadows in the post-apocalyptic twilight. The background is filled with broken buildings and a misty, ash-covered street. Gothic horror meets surreal innocence. Moody lighting, cinematic, painterly style.
