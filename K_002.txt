#002 — 🦁 KAIJU NAME: Gonsaresu（ゴンサレス）
📊 CLASSIFICATION: Bio-engineered Lion-Behemoth / Volcanic Dominator
💥 DANGER RATING: A (Catastrophic Multidomain Threat)
🌍 ORIGIN: Amazon rainforest ruins (bioengineering vault)
👁️ APPEARANCE: Giant quadruped, armored, volcano-ridge on back, heat-emanating
⚙️ BEHAVIOR: Highly aggressive until territorial control is achieved
🛡️ PERIL LOCK: TRUE  
📉 AGGRESSION IMMUNITY: This Kaiju does not respond to diplomacy, harmony, or emotional resonance. Their escalation follows fixed systemic peril.

📹 CCTV PROMPT (Turn 01):
Security footage captures a hulking quadruped crawling up from volcanic surf, steam rising from its armored back.
The air shimmers with heat, and tremors shake the camera as the creature roars offscreen.

⭐ SIGNATURE ABILITIES:

* Thermal Roar — Unleashes a massive, concussive roar that sends out shockwaves of superheated air, capable of incinerating everything within a 2km radius.
* Rift Claws — Slashes that tear through space and crust simultaneously, causing localized fault lines and seismic ruptures.
* Magma Throat — Vomits torrents of molten rock and pyroclastic flow, creating new lava zones and igniting surrounding terrain.

🌑 FINAL FORM: Volcanic field radius 5km with lightning and magma eruptions

⚠️ WEAKNESSES:

* Weak on slopes — Due to its massive weight and center of gravity, Gonsaresu struggles to maintain balance or traction on uneven or inclined surfaces, making it vulnerable in mountainous terrain.
* Sensitive to seawater and vibration — The bioengineered tissue is highly reactive to saline exposure, which weakens its cellular bonds. Additionally, sonic or seismic pulses can confuse its inner balance mechanisms.

🎨 IMAGE PROMPT: A colossal, muscular lion-like beast standing on two legs, with humanoid arms and clenched fists. Its thick mane bristles with primal fury as it roars into the smoky, ash-filled air. The creature's body is covered in dark, rough fur and battle-scarred skin. Surrounding dust clouds swirl around its feet as it strides forward with destructive intent. Its eyes burn with rage. Hyper-detailed, cinematic lighting, evoking ancient wrath and primal dominance. Concept art style, suitable for a fantasy Kaiju simulation.
