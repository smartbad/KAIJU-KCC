* A 2km-long obsidian serpent with a skeletal skull. It flies in spirals and never lands, darkening the sky.

## Behavior Summary

* Emotion-targeting predator. Passive at first but becomes increasingly aggressive with environmental decay. Escalation is inevitable and non-negotiable.

CCTV Prompt (Turn 01 Intro Visual)

A black-and-white surveillance feed from a mountain-top archaeological station shows a starry night sky shimmering unnaturally. Suddenly, a glowing equine figure materializes between ancient ruins—the body pulsating with shifting galaxy patterns of purple and blue.
