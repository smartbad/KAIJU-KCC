 CCTV PROMPT (Turn 01):
A grainy black-and-white CCTV still shows a massive airborne serpent coiling above the coastline.
Its skeletal head and obsidian scales blur through haze, casting a long shadow across the beach
as radio static distorts the feed.

 SIGNATURE ABILITIES:

* Soul-Harvesting Beam — A resonant psychic breath that extracts human souls without physical damage, leaving behind empty vessels.
* Pestilence Incarnate — Releases incurable plagues that mutate ecosystems, corrupt cities, and cause irreversible biological decay.
* Despair Absorption — Feeds on widespread hopelessness, growing stronger as global morale crumbles.
* Emotional Obliteration — Targets and destroys the emotional core of cultures, shattering collective memory and identity.

 FINAL FORM: The Cycle of Unbeing
— PHASE 1 —
She fractures the earth and rises through fault lines, appearing as a continent-length black serpent crowned in white bone, coiling midair as the sun dims.

— PHASE 2 —
The body begins to decay and calcify, becoming a floating ossuary titan. She opens her ribcage and releases a disease-laden tide of emotional ruin over the land. Skeleton towers rise.

— PHASE 3 —
Above the clouds, her skull splits into a burning seraph of skeletal wings and eclipsed fire. Everything under the shadow of her halo forgets the concept of life. Civilization enters mnemonic death.

 WEAKNESSES:

* Psionic harmonics tied to Inanna — Resonant tones associated with Inanna, Ereshkigal’s mythic counterpart, can interrupt her psychic waveform, causing disorientation or retreat.
* Severing anchor soul — She is tethered to a specific ancient soul believed to act as her emotional anchor; isolating or purifying this soul greatly weakens her stability.
* Ritual disruption halts evolution — Interrupting the ceremonial conditions or sacred site alignments she relies on for metamorphosis can lock her in a less dangerous form.

 IMAGE PROMPT: A colossal, night-black serpentine kaiju floating in the sky above a shattered ancient city. Its slick, obsidian body coils in slow, unsettling spirals, 2 kilometers long. The head is an elongated skeletal skull with hollow eyes and a bone-grin, radiating dread. Black radioactive blood drips from wounds and midair fissures, and ghostly vapors surround it like a halo of the dead. A deathly eclipse begins to form behind it, casting a red-black aura over the land. Below, a black flood spreads across the earth, studded with bone towers and infected ruins. The kaiju emits a roar that feels like thousands of human echoes of vanishing life. Cinematic, world-ending tone, heavy atmosphere, interstellar myth horror style.
